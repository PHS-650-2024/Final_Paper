But how does an athlete’s age relate to their performance? Are older Olympic athletes more experienced and disciplined, giving them a competitive edge that results in greater odds of winning a gold medal rather than silver or bronze? How might the link between age and winning gold medals compare to that of other personal characteristics, such as gender identity among athletes competing in mixed-gender teams?"

    "text": "Method\n\nResearch Transparency\nWe value open science and adhered to high standards of research integrity in this study, maximizing research transparency and replicability through several means.\nFirst, we preregistered our research aims, hypotheses, data manipulations, analytic plans, and the exact analytic code proposed for hypothesis testing on the Open Science Framework (OSF). The preregistrations for Aim 1 Laboe (2024) and Aim 2 Ward (2024) are time-stamped and publicly accessible.\nIn this manuscript, we also explicitly label our analyses as confirmatory or exploratory and identify any deviations from the preregistred study protocols.\nFinally, we provide detailed descriptions of our data, methodologies, and data analysis procedures in the following sections and have shared all analysis scripts in our publicly-accessible GitHub repository.\n\n\nData Description\nTo explore these research questions, we conducted a secondary analysis using a longitudinal, historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games. These data include all the Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, but the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. As the Games were staggered on a four year cycle starting with 1994, we used a subset of the Olympics dataset with years 1994 and onwards. The Olympics dataset included the raw variables outlined in Table 1.\nAs this is a secondary analysis of the longitudinal, #tidytuesday ‘Olympics’ dataset, we cannot take credit for collecting or sharing these data with the public. The Olympic data (“Sports Reference | Sports Stats, Fast, Easy, and up-to-Date,” n.d.) is the result of labor performed by a group of Olympic history enthusiasts. For more information, please refer to their blog (“OlympStats” 2024). For details on where and how the Olympic dataset can be accessed, please refer to Kaggle.com (“120 Years of Olympic History: Athletes and Results,” n.d.) and GitHub (“Tidytuesday/Data/2021/2021-07-27 at Master · Rfordatascience/Tidytuesday,” n.d.).\n\n\n\n\nTable 1: Original Data Dictionary\n\n\nVariable\nClass\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nid\ndouble\nAthlete ID\n\n\nname\ncharacter\nAthlete Name\n\n\nsex\ncharacter\nAthlete Sex\n\n\nage\ndouble\nAthlete Age\n\n\nheight\ndouble\nAthlete Height in cm\n\n\nweight\ndouble\nAthlete weight in kg\n\n\nteam\ncharacter\nCountry/Team competing for\n\n\nnoc\ncharacter\nnoc region\n\n\ngames\ncharacter\nOlympic games name\n\n\nyear\ndouble\nYear of olympics\n\n\nseason\ncharacter\nSeason either winter or summer\n\n\ncity\ncharacter\nCity of Olympic host\n\n\nsport\ncharacter\nSport\n\n\nevent\ncharacter\nSpecific event\n\n\nmedal\ncharacter\nMedal (Gold, Silver, Bronze or NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable Scoring\nWe manipulated a few of these variables for use in analyses designed to address our research questions. Please refer to Table 3 for a summary of the changes outlined in more detail below.\n\nGold Medal\nTo create the outcome variable for hypothesis testing, the raw “medal” character variable was recoded as a dichotomous “gold” factor variable with levels for “gold” (1), and “silver or bronze” = (0). Observations for athletes competing during a given year who did not win a medal were treated as not applicable (NA).\n\n\nEvent Gender\nThe raw “event” variable in the Olympics dataset represented multiple variables in one, including the type of sport, whether the event was for individuals or teams, and whether the event was for Men, Women, or Mixed-gender teams.\n\nGood enough practices in scientific computing recommend making each column a variable when working to create analysis-friendly data Wilson et al. (2017). As such, we extracted the gender category from the “event” column and coded a new “event_gender” character variable with categorical levels outlined in Table 2.\n\n\n\n\nTable 2: Event Gender Categories\n\n\nLevels\nn\nPercent\n\n\n\n\nMen's\n182260\n67\n\n\nMixed\n16940\n6\n\n\nWomen's\n71916\n27\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAthlete Gender\nTo create the athlete gender predictor variable for testing Hypothesis 1, the raw “sex” character variable was contrast-coded over zero. Contrast coding is an alternative to dummy coding for representing variables with two categories; it is particularly useful for hypothesis testing as the values are symmetrical around zero (i.e., -0.5 and 0.5), making it easier to interpret regression coefficients Brauer and Curtin (2018). In this case, the coefficient provides the average difference between the two categories, and the intercept reflects the grand mean (i.e., the mean across both categories). This new, dichotomous variable with levels for “M” (-0.5) and “F” (0.5) should facilitate the modeling and interpretation gender-related effects.\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Manipulated Olympics Variables\n\n\nRaw Variables\nOriginal Class\nChange\nNew Variables\nNew Class\n\n\n\n\nmedal\ncharacter\ndichotomized\ngold\nfactor\n\n\nevent\ncharacter\nextracted gender from events\nevent_gender\ncharacter\n\n\nid\ndouble\nconverted to factor\nid\nfactor\n\n\nsex\ncharacter\ncontrast coded\nsex_c\ndouble\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecific Aims\n\nAim 1\nTo analyze the influence of biological sex on the likelihood of winning a gold medal among athletes who competed as members of mixed-gender teams in the Olympic Games from 1994 onwards.\n\n\nAim 2\nTo analyze the influence of age on the likelihood of winning a gold medal for Olympic athletes from 1994 onwards, controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete by employing a mixed-effects logistic regression model.\n\n\n\nHypotheses\n\nHypothesis 1\nH1: Males will be more likely to receive a gold medal during the Olympic Games than their female teammates.\n\n\nHypothesis 2\nH2: After controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete, the likelihood of winning a gold medal from 1994 onwards is significantly, positively associated with the age of the athlete, such that every one-unit increase in age increases the odds of winning gold (versus silver or bronze)."
