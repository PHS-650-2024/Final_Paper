## Introduction

The Olympic Games, a prestigious international sporting event, epitomize the pinnacle of athleticism. Athletes who qualify to compete at the Olympics represent the elite, possessing physical capabilities that are nothing short of exceptional. However, the intensity of competing at such a high level can exert a significant toll on their bodies, challenging their physical limits through rigorous competitions and demanding training schedules. Fortunately, recent advancements in sports medicine have played a crucial role in supporting these athletes.

Innovations in rehabilitation techniques, injury prevention, and nutritional strategies are enabling athletes to extend their careers, competing effectively at more advanced ages relative to some of their peers. This progress not only enhances their performance but also improves their recovery and overall health, allowing them to maintain peak physical condition for longer than ever before. But how does an athlete's age relate to their performance? Are older Olympic athletes more experienced and disciplined, giving them a competitive edge that results in greater odds of winning a gold medal rather than silver or bronze? How might the link between age and winning gold medals compare to that of other personal characteristics, such as the biological sex of athletes competing in mixed-gender teams?

## Method

### Research Transparency

We value open science and adhered to high standards of research integrity in this study, maximizing research transparency and replicability through several means.

First, we preregistered our research aims, hypotheses, data manipulations, analytic plans, and the exact analytic code proposed for hypothesis testing on the Open Science Framework (OSF). Preregistrations for Aims 1 [@laboe2024] and 2 [@ward2024] are time-stamped and publicly accessible.

We also provide R scripts for scoring and hypothesis testing on this project's publicly-accessible GitHub repository; these analysis scripts can be run in their entirety with the Olympics data. Finally, we provide detailed descriptions of our data, methodologies, and data analysis procedures in the following sections.

### Data Description

To explore these research questions, we conducted a secondary analysis using a longitudinal, historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games. These data include all the Games, from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016, but the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. As the Games were staggered on a four year cycle starting with 1994, we used a subset of the *Olympics* dataset with years 1994 and onwards. The Olympics dataset included the raw variables outlined in @tbl-raw.

As this is a secondary analysis of the longitudinal, #tidytuesday 'Olympics' dataset, we cannot take credit for collecting or sharing these data with the public. The Olympic data is the result of labor performed by a group of Olympic history enthusiasts. For more information, please refer to their blog [@olympsta2024]. For details on where and how the Olympic dataset can be accessed, please refer to GitHub [@tidytuesday2024] and Kaggle.com [@griffin2018].

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-raw
#| tbl-cap: "Original Data Dictionary"

# create a data frame for the original Olympic data dictionary
raw_vars <- data.frame(
  Variable = c("id", "name", "sex", "age", "height", "weight", "team", 
               "noc", "games", "year", "season", "city", "sport", "event", "medal"),
  Class = c("double", "character", "character", "double", "double", "double", "character", 
            "character", "character", "double", "character", "character", "character", "character", "character"),
  Description = c("Athlete ID", "Athlete Name", "Athlete Sex", "Athlete Age", 
                  "Athlete Height in cm", "Athlete weight in kg", "Country/Team competing for",
                  "noc region", "Olympic games name", "Year of olympics", "Season either winter or summer",
                  "City of Olympic host", "Sport", "Specific event", "Medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze or NA)")
)

kable(raw_vars, booktabs = TRUE, align = 'lll', col.names = c("Variable", "Class", "Description")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

### Variable Scoring

We manipulated a few of these variables for use in analyses designed to address our research questions. Please refer to @tbl-new for a summary of the changes outlined in more detail below.

#### Gold Medal

To create the outcome variable for hypothesis testing, the raw "medal" character variable was recoded as a dichotomous "gold" factor variable with levels for "gold" (1), and "silver or bronze" = (0). Observations for athletes competing during a given year who did not win a medal were treated as not applicable (NA).

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-new
#| tbl-cap: "Manipulated Olympics Variables"

new_vars <- data.frame(
  raw_variables = c("medal", "event", "id", "sex"),
  original_class = c("character", "character", "double", "character"),
  change = c("dichotomized", "extracted gender from events", "converted to factor", "contrast coded"),
  new_variables = c("gold", "event_gender", "id", "sex_c"),
  new_class = c("factor", "character", "factor", "double")
)

kable(new_vars, booktabs = TRUE, align = 'lll', 
      col.names = c("Raw Variables", "Original Class", "Change", "New Variables", "New Class")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Event Gender

The raw "event" variable in the Olympics dataset represented multiple variables in one, including the type of sport, whether the event was for individuals or teams, and whether the event was for Men, Women, or Mixed-gender teams.\
\
Good enough practices in scientific computing recommend making each column a variable when working to create analysis-friendly data [@wilson2017]. As such, we extracted gender from the "event" column and coded a new "event_gender" character variable with categorical levels outlined in @tbl-gend.

```{r,echo=FALSE}
#| label: tbl-gend
#| tbl-cap: "Event Gender Categories"
ev_gend <- data.frame(
  levels = c("Men's", "Mixed", "Women's"),
  n = c("182260", "16940", "71916"),
  percent = c("67", "6", "27"))

kable(ev_gend, booktabs = TRUE, align = 'lll', 
      col.names = c("Levels", "n", "Percent")) %>%
  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)
```

#### Athlete Biological Sex

To create the athlete sex predictor variable for testing Hypothesis 1, the raw "sex" character variable was contrast-coded over zero. Contrast coding is an alternative to dummy coding for representing variables with two categories; it is particularly useful for hypothesis testing as the values are symmetrical around zero (i.e., -0.5 and 0.5), easing interpretations of regression coefficients [@brauer2018].

In this case, the coefficient provides the average difference between the two categories, and the intercept reflects the grand mean (i.e., the mean across both categories). This new, dichotomous variable with levels for "M" (-0.5) and "F" (0.5) should facilitate the modeling and interpretation of sex-related effects.

### Specific Aims

#### Aim 1

We first aimed to analyze the influence of biological sex on the likelihood of winning a gold medal among athletes who competed as members of mixed-gender teams and won a medal in the Olympic Games from 1994 onward.

#### Aim 2

We also aimed to analyze the influence of age on the likelihood of winning a gold medal for Olympic athletes from 1994 onward, controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete by employing a mixed-effects logistic regression model.

### Hypotheses

#### Hypothesis 1

H1: Males will be more likely to receive a gold medal during the Olympic Games than their female teammates.

#### Hypothesis 2

H2: After controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete, the likelihood of winning a gold medal from 1994 onward is significantly, positively associated with the age of the athlete, such that every one-unit increase in age increases the odds of winning gold (versus silver or bronze).

## Results

### Aim 1

We ran a generalized linear mixed effects model, controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete, to test Hypothesis 1. Hypothesis 1 was not supported. As depicted in @fig-aim1fig1, being female instead of male was associated with a -0.326 decrease in log likelihood of winning a gold medal (if winning a medal) for individuals who participated in a mix-gender Olympic sport after 1994. However, this effect was not statistically significant (p=0.124).

```

### Aim 2

We ran a generalized linear mixed effects model, controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete, to test Hypothesis 2. Hypothesis 2 was not supported. AIC and BIC provide a measure of the model's quality and complexity, with lower values generally indicating a better fit. These values (AIC = 18246.7, BIC = 18269.5) suggest the model was a poor fit to the data. As depicted in @fig-aim2fig1, for every one unit increase in age, the odds of winning a gold medal increased by only 0.002, and this effect was not significant (p=0.934). See @tbl-aim2 for more information.

## Discussion

In sum, we conducted a secondary analysis of the longitudinal, #tidytuesday 'Olympics' dataset. Specifically, we sought to examine the effect of biological sex on winning a gold medal (when any medal was won) for individuals who competed in a mixed-gender Olympic sport after 1992. We also aimed to investigate the effect of age on winning a gold medal (when any medal was won) for individuals who competed in the Olympic Games after 1992.

Our first hypothesis was that males would be more likely to win a gold medal during the Olympic Games than females. This hypothesis was not supported. The lack of support is likely due to the fact that many mixed-gender sports are team-based (e.g., figure skating), such that if a male on a given team wins a gold medal, so will a female. Future analyses can look at the effect of gender on the odds of winning a gold medal when men and women are not on the same team.

Our second hypothesis was that after controlling for the non-independence of multiple observations per athlete, the likelihood of winning a gold medal from 1994 onward would be significantly, positively associated with the age of the athlete, such that every one-unit increase in age would increase the odds of winning gold (versus silver or bronze). This hypothesis was not supported. Future research should investigate differences in peak performance age ranges between sport and event types. Perhaps older, more experienced and disciplined athletes are at an advantage during certain sports, whereas younger athletes with fewer competing life-commitments and a lower likelihood of prior injury have the competitive edge in other event types.
